    Travel is the movement of people between distant geographical locations. Travel can be done by foot, bicycle, automobile, 
    train, boat, bus, airplane, ship or other means, with or without luggage, and can be one way or round trip.
    The primary role of a travel agent is to help people make travel arrangements, which might include booking flights, hotels, sightseeing tours, and making dining recommendations.
     A travel agent assesses each customer's unique needs, preferences, and budget to ensure their trip goes as smoothly as possible.
